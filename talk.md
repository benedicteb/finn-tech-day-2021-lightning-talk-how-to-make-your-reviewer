* ~~We've always done it~~



# Why improve code review?

* Learn **quicker**
* Be a **good example**
* **Minimize** friction



# ‚≠ê Golden rule ‚≠ê

> Value your reviewer's time



# pt. 1

> Review your own code **first**



# pt. 2

> Give a clear context



# pt. 3

The age of using people as CI should be over üôà



# pt. 4

> Make the code answer the questions

# pt. 8

> Be thankful



# pt. 9

> **Be patient** when your reviewer is wrong

In **MY** code? That's impossible!



# pt. 10

> Communicate status clearly



# pt. 11

> Award all ties to your reviewer

Tennis-style!



# pt. 12

> Minimize time between review rounds



# But...

can the reviewer do something? ü§î



# Take aways

1. Let the reviewer focus on the important stuff
2. We don't need big PRs
3. Have empathy! Being evaluated is tense



# Congrats! üéâ

People will now fall in love with you! ‚ù§Ô∏è
