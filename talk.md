# Why code review?

* **More** eyes
* Make others **better** ✨
* ~~We've always done it~~



# Why improve code review?

* Learn **quicker**
* Be a **good example**
* **Minimize** friction



# ⭐ Golden rule ⭐

> Value your reviewer's time



# pt. 1

> Review your own code **first**



# pt. 2

> Give a clear context

What **earthly problem** are we solving here?



# pt. 3

> Automate the easy stuff

The age of using people as CI should be over 🙈



# pt. 4

> Make the code answer the questions

# pt. 5

> Narrow down the scope

Go away **scope creep**! Don't want'cha here..



# pt. 6

> Separate functional and non-functional changes

3-step deployment yo'

# pt. 8

> Be thankful

You made a **great** PR if the reviewer finds things



# pt. 9

> **Be patient** when your reviewer is wrong

In **MY** code? That's impossible!



# pt. 10

> Communicate status clearly

Ready for re-review!



# pt. 11

> Award all ties to your reviewer

Tennis-style!



# pt. 12

> Minimize time between review rounds



# But...

can the reviewer do something? 🤔



# Take aways

1. Enable the reviewer to focus on the **important stuff**
2. We _don't_ need big PRs
3. Have **empathy** 💕! Being evaluated is tense



# Congrats! 🎉

People will now fall in love with you! ❤️
