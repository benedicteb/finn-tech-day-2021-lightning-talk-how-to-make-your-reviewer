# Why code review?

* **More** eyes
* Make others **better** ✨
* ~~We've always done it~~



# Why improve code review?

* Learn **quicker**
* Be a **good example**
* **Minimize** friction



# Golden rule

> Value your reviewer's time



# pt. 1

> Review your own code **first**



# pt. 2

> Give a clear context



# pt. 3

> Automate the easy stuff



# pt. 4

> Make the code answer the questions



# pt. 5

> Narrow down the scope



# pt. 5

> Separate functional and non-functional changes



# pt. 7

> Divide up large changes



# pt. 8

> Be thankful



# pt. 9

> **Be patient** when your reviewer is wrong



# pt. 10

> Communicate status clearly



# pt. 11

> Give the reviewer the benefit of the doubt



# pt. 12

> Minimize time between review rounds



# But...

can the reviewer do something? 🤔



# Take aways

1. Let the reviewer focus on the important stuff
2. We don't need big PRs
3. Have empathy! Being evaluated is tense



# Congrats! 🎉

People will now fall in love with you! ❤️
